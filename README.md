The main character departs his temporary, basic shelter in search of a frightening creature
that ravaged and destroyed his former home. Making use of their unique ability to rapidly ‘evolve’
new abilities or extensions, the main character travels through the world, often using these
evolutions to solve puzzles or discover secrets along the way. With each ‘evolution’ the character
model permanently changes to support it, becoming increasingly terrifying and twisted as the game
progresses.

Since the world has been largely blasted and torn apart by the creature, the character will mainly
need to use runes and other writings left by fellow refugees to piece together its story and
background, as well as what happened to the refugees themselves. In the end, after finally defeating
the monster, the player is forced to face the ‘at what cost’ dilemma, as they realize that the steps
and evolutions they took in order to face the hideous, deformed monster have turned them into one
themselves.
